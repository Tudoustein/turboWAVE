GPGPU on Windows 10
===================

.. caution::

	We assume core turboWAVE **and** tools have already been installed according to the documentation, with no steps omitted.

Driver
------

Update to the latest graphics drivers, following the guidance on the vendor's website.

Compile with OpenCL
-------------------

#. Edit :samp:`{twroot}/core/source/makefile`
#. In the makefile, you must comment/uncomment lines to select platform, hardware acceleration, compiler, and package manager.  You will only be editing the lines between :samp:`BEGIN INPUT VARIABLES BLOCK` and :samp:`END INPUT VARIABLES BLOCK`.  In a makefile, comments are preceded by :samp:`#`.  For this installation, only :samp:`PLATFORM = OSX` and :samp:`HARDWARE_ACCEL = APPLE_CL`, should be uncommented.
#. Edit :samp:`{twroot}/core/source/definitions.h`
#. In the definitions file, you must comment/uncomment lines to select platform and acceleration options.  In a C++ file, comments are preceded by :samp:`//`, and :samp:`#` is **not** a comment.  For this installation, only :samp:`#define USE_DESKTOP` and :samp:`#define USE_OPENCL` should be uncommented.
#. Open a new terminal window and navigate to :samp:`{twroot}/core/source`
#. Type :samp:`make`
#. The makefile should automatically copy the executable into your :samp:`~/bin` directory for later use.  The OpenCL kernel files will be copied into :samp:`~/Run`.  The OpenCL enabled code will not run without the kernel files.
