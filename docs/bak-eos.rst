Equations of State (EOS)
=========================

The Equation of State (EOS) tools calculate thermodynamic quantities (such as pressure, :math:`P`, and Temperature, :math:`T` ) from fluid quantities (such as energy density, :math:`u`, and particle density, :math:`n`). In other words, each EOS tool represents a set of functions such as :math:`P(n,u)` and :math:`T(n,u)`. Some EOS tools are useful for a restricted class of problems, such as ideal gases, or low temperature solids. Others utilize tables generated by other software and can, in principle, be very general.  The user selects the tools, and therefore the EOS models, to associate with a given hydrodynamic simulation.

There are two types of EOS relations that need to be specified to describe the material completely: the thermal EOS gives :math:`P(n,T)`, and the caloric EOS gives :math:`\epsilon(n,T)`. In many applications the caloric EOS reduces to a constant specific heat, :math:`C_v`, with the relation :math:`d\epsilon = C_v dT`.

The importance of EOS for hydrodynamics simulations is that :math:`P` and :math:`T` are needed to close the equations of gas dynamics.

The Principle Hugoniot
----------------------

The Rankine-Hugoniot relation is discussed here because of its relevance to EOS models that use a point along the Hugoniot as a reference point for a broader calculation of EOS. They describe the relationship between the states on both sides of a abrupt density and momentum discontinuity (shock wave) traveling through a material at a shock speed :math:`D`. The collection of possible final states resulting from these relations, given zero initial particle speed and pressure of a material, is called the principle Hugoniot. There are an infinite number of possible Hugoniots for a material depending on its initial conditions, but there is only one principle Hugoniot for any given material, and the principle Hugoniot is, physically speaking, determined by the EOS of the material. For this reason experiments which measure the shock velocity vs. fluid velocity for various materials are a means of validating equations of state.

The Hugoniot relations are fundamentally an expression of the convervation of mass, momentum, and energy. Suppose that a planar shock front moves through a fluid at speed :math:`D`. The pressure and density of the material prior to the passing of the shock front are :math:`P_0` and :math:`\rho_0`, respectively. Immediately after the shock passes the pressure and density are :math:`P` and :math:`\rho`. Similarly, :math:`V` and :math:`V_0` are the final and initial specific volumes, respectively, and :math:`\epsilon` and :math:`\epsilon_0` are the final and initial specific internal energies.

A detailed derivation will not be presented here (an example of one can be found in Ref. [1]), but an outline is as follows. Setting the quantity of mass entering and leaving the shock as equal (conservation of mass) gives

:math:`\rho ( D - v ) = \rho_0 ( D - v_0 ).`

The change in momentum density across the shock front is due to the impulse associated with the pressure difference, leading to

:math:`P - P_0 = \rho_0 (D - v_0) (v - v_0).`

The work done by the pressure (PV work) gives the change in specific internal energy, i.e.,

:math:`\epsilon - \epsilon_0 = \frac{1}{2} (P + P_0) (V - V_0).`

Experimentally, data for :math:`D` and :math:`v` are collected by inducing a shock in a substance and observing its propagation (and one may suppose :math:`P_0 \approx 0` and :math:`v_0 \approx 0` so that we are referring to the principle Hugoniot). The density, pressure, and energy are calculated with the above equations and the EOS values along the shock front are found. In practice, for most solids the relationship between the shock velocity and particle velocity is found to be linear, and approximated by

:math:`D = c_0 + S_1 v.`

where the y-intercept :math:`c_0` and the slope :math:`S_1` are the parameters of a linear fit to the experimental data.  The parameter :math:`c_0` is usually close to the speed of sound in the material.

Mie Gruneisen EOS Theory
-------------------------

The simplest EOS implemented in Turbowave, other than the default ideal gas model, is the Mie-Gruneisen EOS, which is often used to describe a shock-compressed solid. It is an example of an incomplete EOS, as it only provides the pressure, and not the temperature, as a function of the specific internal energy. A basic assumption of the Mie Gruneisen model is that the thermal energy of a material is adequately described as the sum of the energies of a collection of simple harmonic oscillators with frequencies :math:`\nu_i(V)`, which are functions of specific volume only. It neglects electronic contributions to the internal energy.

A detailed derivation of this EOS is given in Ref. [1]. Here we give a basic outline. Given the physical description detailed above, the Helmholtz free energy for the system is

:math:`F = \phi(V) + \sum_{i=1}^{3 N} \frac{h \nu_i}{2} + k T \sum_{i=1}^{3 N}\ln(1 - e^{-h \nu_i/kT}),`

where :math:`\phi(V)` is the potential energy of the material with :math:`N` atoms in a total volume, :math:`V`. The sum is over the :math:`3 N` normal modes of the atoms. We can determine an expression for pressure by :math:`P = - ( \partial F/\partial V)_T`, which results in various derivatives of :math:`\nu_i (V)`. We define

:math:`\gamma_i \equiv -\frac{d \ln v_i}{d \ln V} = -\frac{V}{\nu_i} \left( \frac{d v_i}{d V} \right),`

and substitute all the derivatives of :math:`\nu_i` with expressions of :math:`\gamma_i`. If we assume that all :math:`\gamma_i` are the same ( or :math:`\gamma_i = \gamma_G` ), :math:`\gamma_G` can be factored out of the sum, leaving an expression that can be expressed as a function of vibrational energy. If the internal energy is a sum of vibrational and potential energy (:math:`E = E_\text{vib} + \phi(V)`),

:math:`P - P_R = \frac{\gamma_G}{V} (E - E_R),`

where the reference internal energy, :math:`E_R`, can be on any reference curve. This expression is useful for calculating states off the Hugoniot relative to measured states on the Hugoniot. The quantity :math:`\gamma_G` is called the Gruneisen parameter, and is defined by

:math:`\gamma_G = V \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial E} \right)_V.`

The numerical value of :math:`\gamma_G` for a given material at a given density can be experimentally measured and may be looked up from available tables and databases (See for example Refs. [2] and [3]).

Broadly speaking, the Gruneisen parameter describes the effect that changing the volume (and spacing) of a crystal lattice has on its vibrational proterties, and subsequently, on its pressure/size dynamics.

Mie Gruneisen EOS Implementation
---------------------------------

Due to varying assumptions implicit in the functional dependence of :math:`\gamma` on volume, choice of reference pressure, :math:`P_R`, and energy, :math:`E_r`, and the fit of the Hugoniot that may be used for reference, several different implementations of the Mie-Gruneisen pressure calculation are possible. Here we present two different Mie Gruneisen pressure calculations currently available in turboWAVE, alongside their associated input parameters. Both of these models currently assume constant :math:`C_v`, with :math:`d\epsilon = C_v dT`. The models differ in the pressure calculation only.

		.. py:function:: eos = simple-mie-grunseisen

			As a very rough implementation of the mie-gruneisen pressure law, we might treat :math:`\gamma_G` as a constant value specified at the input. Values for :math:`\gamma_G` can be looked up on tables for specific reference densities, and is approximately correct if the density does not significantly deviate from the reference density. In addition, this minimal implementation simply lets :math:`E_R = 0` and :math:`P_R = 0` rather than referring to a experimentally known reference point or Hugoniot curve. It qualitatively describes Mie Gruneisen - like pressure behavior, but will not in most cases quantitatively recreate known physical results, such as the sound speed for the material.

		.. py:function:: eos = mie-grunseisen

			A better approximation that is usually good is to take the Gruneisen coefficient as proportional to the specific volume ( :math:`\rho \gamma_G = \text{Const.}` ). This implementation uses this assumption, and in addition, implicitly derives reference energies and pressure from a linear Hugoniot fit. As a result, two additional parameters are needed to be specified; The y-intercept of the Hugoniot, :math:`c_0`, and the slope of the linear fit, :math:`S_1` must be given in the input deck in addition to the reference Gruneisen parameter. These may be acquired from published Hugoniot measurements (See Refs. [2] and [3]).

In principle other, more complex implementations of the Mie Gruneisen EOS may be added in the future, such as potentiall the one in Ref. [1], which uses a cubic interpolation of the Hugoniot and allows for a small linear deviation from the assumption that ( :math:`\rho \gamma_G = \text{Const.}` ). These seem to not be necessary for typical solids, for which the linear interpolation is sufficient. In addition, a different caloric EOS may be implimented in combination with these models. This background will be extended as needed to illustrate the underlying differences in such models.
