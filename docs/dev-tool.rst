Tool
====

The ``ComputeTool`` object is used to perform calculations that may be re-used by various modules.

.. note::

	While ``Module`` objects have been part of turboWAVE almost from the inception, ``ComputeTool`` objects were introduced later.  As of this writing, there are many objects living in the framework that could be more neatly implemented as a ``ComputeTool``.  Over time it is expected these loose objects will be absorbed into the ``ComputeTool`` paradigm.
