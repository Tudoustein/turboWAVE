Tools Installation
===================

General Notes
-------------

Most of the tools are built on Python 3, except for the native MacOS DataViewer application.  There is an old Windows XP DataViewer which may partially work on modern Windows.  For Python, it is highly recommended to operate in a virtual environment.  Virtual environments can be created using native Python tools, or Anaconda.

We do not cover installing the tools on HPC.

.. note::

	Tool versions are synchronized with core.  For the best results, keep the installed version numbers consistent.
