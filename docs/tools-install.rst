Tools Installation
===================

General Notes
-------------

Most of the tools are built on Python 3.  It is highly recommended to operate in a virtual environment.  Virtual environments can be created using native Python tools, or Anaconda.

We do not cover installing the tools on HPC.

.. note::

	Tools are synchronized with core to within major and minor version numbers (the patch and build numbers may differ).  For the best results, keep the installed versions consistent.
